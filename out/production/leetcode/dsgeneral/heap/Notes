A Heap is a special tree data structure with the following properties:
1) All the Node is greater/smaller than the decendent
2) It must be a complete binary tree


There are two type of heaps:
1) Max Heap: 
In Max-heap the key present at the root must be greatest among the key at all it's children.
The same hold true for all sub-tree in that Binary Tree

2) Min Heap:
In Min-Heap that key present at the root must be smaller among the key at all it's children.
The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree
