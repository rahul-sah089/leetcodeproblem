Array, LInked List , Stack adn Queue are linear data structure
Non linear data structure:
Tree: Used to represent the Hierarchical Data Structure. It uses parent, child relationship to represent Hirerachy

Graph : Used to represent the friend relationship. We cannot use tree if we have random between the codes.
Graph data structure allows connection between any data structure

Graph Data strucuture is represent by paisr of set

G = (V,E) 

V = {v1,v2,v3,v4,v5}

E = {(v1,v2),(v1,v3),(v1,v4),(v1,v5),(v2,v3),(v2,v4)}

Direct vs Undirected Graph

Maximum Number of Edges in Directed Graph = |V| *(|V|-1)
Maximum Number of Edges in Undirected Graph = [|V| * (|V|-1)]/2
